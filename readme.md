# p-series

> Run promise-returning & async functions in series

If you're doing the same work in each function, use [`p-each-series`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-each-series) instead.

See [`p-all`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-all) for a concurrent counterpart.

## Install

```
$ npm install p-series
```

## Usage

```js
const pSeries = require('p-series');
const got = require('got');

(async () => {
	const tasks = [
		() => got('https://sindresorhus.com'),
		() => checkSomething(),
		() => doSomethingElse()
	];

	console.log(await pSeries(tasks));
})();
```

## API

### pSeries(tasks)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises returned from calling the functions in `tasks` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the fulfilled values.

#### tasks

Type: `Iterable<Function>`

Functions are expected to return a value. If a Promise is returned, it's awaited before continuing with the next task.
